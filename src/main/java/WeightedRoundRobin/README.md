## The Weighted Round Robin load balancing algorithm is an extension of the traditional Round Robin algorithm, but it takes into account the different capacities or capabilities of servers by assigning them weights. Servers with higher weights are assigned a proportionally larger number of requests compared to servers with lower weights. This ensures that the load is distributed in a way that reflects the server's capacity.

Here are the details of the Weighted Round Robin load balancing algorithm:

## Initialization:

Servers are assigned weights that represent their capacity or processing power. The weights are usually positive integers.
The load balancer maintains a list of servers, each associated with its weight.
A variable, often called currentIndex, is used to keep track of the current server being selected.

## Request Handling:

When a new request arrives at the load balancer, it selects the next server based on the currentIndex.
The request is then routed to the selected server.
## Server Selection:

Servers are selected in a circular or cyclical manner, similar to the Round Robin algorithm.
However, the selection takes into account the weight of each server.
## Weight-Based Distribution:

The load balancer distributes requests based on the weight of each server.
Servers with higher weights receive more requests compared to those with lower weights.
For example, if Server A has a weight of 2 and Server B has a weight of 1, Server A will receive twice as many requests as Server B.
## Balanced Load:

Weighted Round Robin ensures that servers with higher capacity are utilized more effectively while still providing a basic form of load balancing across all servers.
Dynamic Changes:

Weighted Round Robin can handle dynamic changes, such as adding or removing servers, by adjusting the weights accordingly.
Simple Implementation:

It is relatively simple to implement and does not require complex algorithms or real-time monitoring of server conditions.
Scalability:

Weighted Round Robin is suitable for a variety of server pool sizes and can be used in both small and large deployments.
Use Cases:

This algorithm is useful in scenarios where servers have different capabilities, processing capacities, or hardware specifications.
It's commonly used in scenarios where fairness in request distribution is important.
Server Failure Handling:

In cases of server failures, requests continue to be distributed to the remaining servers based on their weights.
While Weighted Round Robin is effective for many scenarios, it may not be suitable for situations with highly variable workloads or when more advanced load balancing strategies, such as Dynamic Weight Adjustment or Health-Based Routing, are required to optimize resource usage and improve overall performance.
